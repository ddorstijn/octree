# Octree

A simple octree implementation written in C. Build as a DLL, the original creation was to be used for the visualization of the milky way.

# To do:

  - Octree splitting
  - C# implementation example
  - Find node based on position
  - Frustum culling
  - Raycasting

Nice-to-have:
  - Dynamic octree support
  - KD-tree support
  - Interface for objects
